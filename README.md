# Tester-modules
Some modules I created in my first job as QA
I'm uploading some classes I created to make easier my job as tester, some classes have something called
'import constants as c', I can't upload that file for security reasons but over there you can add connection strings, databases or servers directions and sometimes, users/pwd
In my work I use a lot of Selenium with some implementations I did to our servers to use Jenkins with SeleniumGrid in some AWS EC2 Ubuntu/Windows instances.
In this classes I use:
  Lambdas, Collections, Requests.
  Lots of Libs:
    Selenium
    pdfminer
    boto
    pymssql
    psycopg2
    openpyxl
  And the ones from Python such:
    os
    platform
    UNITTEST (since well, we are testers!!)
    email.mime
    strings
    shutil
    sys
    RANDOM (Best tool to test, there are N posibilities!!)
